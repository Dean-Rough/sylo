# This script starts the AI Chat Core (Python/FastAPI) in development mode.

# TODO: Update this script with the actual command to start the FastAPI server.
# Common FastAPI development server command (using uvicorn):
#    uvicorn main:app --reload
# Ensure 'main:app' matches your FastAPI application instance (e.g., main.py with an app object).
# You might need to specify host and port, e.g., --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Design Studio Productivity App

Welcome to the Design Studio Productivity App monorepo! This project aims to create a comprehensive, AI-powered productivity suite for design studios. It's architected around an intelligent AI chat interface that orchestrates a wide array of features to automate tasks, enhance project management, streamline communication, and boost overall efficiency.

## Overview

This application leverages a modern technology stack to deliver a seamless and powerful user experience, evolving from a core AI chat and prompt management system into a full-fledged productivity platform:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React) with TypeScript, styled using Shadcn UI / Radix UI + Tailwind CSS, hosted on Vercel.
*   **Backend API:** A dedicated NestJS application (TypeScript) handles the primary backend logic, including interactions with Supabase, orchestration of the AI Chat Core, and other API functionalities.
*   **Database & Authentication:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) provides the database, user authentication (Google OAuth), and storage capabilities.
*   **AI Chat Core:** A separate Python FastAPI service handles advanced AI logic, OpenAI model interactions, and manages persistent chat memory and user AI preferences via Supabase.

*   **üìÖ AI Calendar:** Intelligently schedules your tasks, meetings, and to-dos into an optimized daily plan.
*   **‚úÖ AI Task Manager:** Auto-schedules tasks based on deadlines and priorities, adjusting in real-time.
*   **üìù AI Meeting Notetaker:** Automatically records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings, converting action items into tasks.
*   **üîÑ AI Workflows:** Transforms ideas into structured projects and automates routine task assignments and reminders.
*   **üìä AI Gantt Chart:** Maintains accurate, real-time project timelines with easy drag-and-drop adjustments.
*   **ü§ù AI Meeting Assistant:** Simplifies meeting scheduling with personalized booking pages and templates.

## Monorepo Structure

This repository is a monorepo managed by [Nx/Turborepo - *Specify Chosen Tool Here*].

*   `apps/`: Contains the individual applications:
    *   `web/`: The Next.js frontend.
    *   `api-main/`: The NestJS backend application.
    *   `ai-chat-core/`: The Python FastAPI AI Chat Core service.
*   `packages/`: Contains shared code and configurations:
    *   `ui/`: Shared React UI components.
    *   `config/`: Shared ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configurations.
    *   `types/`: Shared TypeScript types and interfaces.

## Getting Started

The initial directory structure has been established. Detailed instructions for setting up the development environment, installing dependencies using the chosen monorepo tool, and running the applications will be added as these components are further developed.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (specify version)
*   npm/yarn/pnpm (specify preferred package manager)
*   Python (specify version for AI Chat Core)
*   Poetry (or pip for Python package management)
*   Docker (for running local instances of Supabase or other services if needed)
*   Access to Supabase project credentials.
*   OpenAI API key.
*   Google Cloud Platform project for OAuth credentials.

### Setup

1.  **Initial Directory Structure:** The foundational directory structure as defined in [`DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`](DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md:20) has been created. This includes the main `apps/`, `packages/`, and `.github/WORKFLOWS/` directories, along with their initial subdirectories ([`apps/web/`](apps/web/), [`apps/api-main/`](apps/api-main/), [`apps/ai-chat-core/`](apps/ai-chat-core/), [`packages/ui/`](packages/ui/), etc.) and placeholder `.env.example` files in [`apps/web/.env.example`](apps/web/.env.example:0) and [`apps/ai-chat-core/.env.example`](apps/ai-chat-core/.env.example:0).
2.  Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
3.  Install root dependencies: `[npm/yarn/pnpm] install` (Note: Monorepo tooling like Nx or Turborepo setup is pending).
4.  Set up environment variables:
    *   Copy the `.env.example` files located in [`apps/web/`](apps/web/) and [`apps/ai-chat-core/`](apps/ai-chat-core/) to `.env` (or `.env.local` for Next.js within `apps/web/`).
    *   Fill in the required credentials and configuration values.
5.  *(Further setup instructions for each app/package and monorepo tooling will be added here.)*

## Development

### AI Chat Core (`apps/ai-chat-core/`)

To start the AI Chat Core service in development mode:

Navigate to the service directory and run the startup script:
```bash
cd apps/ai-chat-core
./scripts/go.sh
```
Alternatively, you can use the `start-dev.sh` script directly:
```bash
cd apps/ai-chat-core
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```
The service will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:4000`.

*(Instructions for other applications, tests, linting, etc., will be added as they are developed.)*

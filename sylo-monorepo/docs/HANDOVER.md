# Project Handover Document: Multi-Model AI Orchestration

## Current Project State

### Architecture Overview
- Implemented flexible multi-model AI orchestration system
- Supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Dynamic model selection and configuration framework

### Existing Capabilities
- Model Provider Support:
  * OpenAI: gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo
  * Anthropic: claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet

- Core Features:
  * Configurable model settings
  * Provider-agnostic service interface
  * Basic model priority and selection mechanism
  * Cost tracking for different models

## Immediate Development Priorities

### Model Selection Enhancement
1. Develop advanced selection algorithms
   - Implement machine learning-driven model recommendation
   - Create comprehensive performance tracking
   - Design intelligent fallback mechanisms

2. Expand Model Capabilities
   - Improve model capability detection
   - Add more detailed performance metrics
   - Implement context-aware model selection

### Technical Challenges
- Design flexible, extensible model selection framework
- Implement real-time performance tracking
- Manage diverse AI provider capabilities
- Balance performance, cost, and user experience

## Recommended Next Steps

### Short-Term (Q3 2025)
1. Implement comprehensive model performance tracking
2. Develop machine learning model recommendation system
3. Create advanced fallback and error handling strategies
4. Expand provider support with additional AI models

### Medium-Term (Q4 2025)
1. Build user-specific model preference system
2. Develop advanced prompt engineering tools
3. Implement federated learning prototype
4. Create detailed model capability analysis

### Long-Term Vision
- Build adaptive AI service platform
- Create provider-agnostic AI orchestration system
- Develop intelligent, context-aware model selection

## Current Limitations
- Basic priority-based model selection
- Limited performance tracking
- No machine learning-driven recommendations
- Minimal fallback mechanism implementation

## Technical Debt and Improvement Areas
1. Enhance error handling in model services
2. Implement more sophisticated caching mechanisms
3. Develop comprehensive logging for model interactions
4. Create more granular model capability detection

## Recommended Research Areas

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/js?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.

## Development Status &amp; Known Issues

This section tracks the progress and current status of development tasks and any known issues within the monorepo.

**Nx Target Execution (as of 2025-05-20):**

*   **`api-main` Build (`npx nx build api-main`):**
    *   **Initial Problem:** Build failed with `"The "@nx/nest" package does not support Nx executors."`
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        *   Added `@nx/nest` (v21.0.3) to `devDependencies` in the root `package.json`.
        *   Ensured `@nx/nest` is registered as a plugin in `nx.json`.
        *   Corrected `tsConfig` path in `apps/api-main/project.json` to `apps/api-main/tsconfig.build.json`.
        *   Removed non-existent `webpackConfig` from `apps/api-main/project.json`.
    *   **Current Status:** **STILL FAILING.** The error persists: `"The "@nx/nest" package does not support Nx executors."`
    *   **Suspected Cause:** A Node.js version mismatch. The current environment uses Node.js v23.7.0, while `nx@21.0.3` requires `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0`. This incompatibility is the most likely reason for the executor not being recognized.
    *   **Recommendation:** Switch to a compatible Node.js version (e.g., v20.x or v22.x).

*   **`ai-chat-core` Dependency Installation (`npx nx run ai-chat-core:install-deps`):**
    *   **Initial Problem:** Encountered executor misconfiguration and undefined exit codes, though the underlying script (`scripts/install-deps.sh`) worked directly.
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        *   Verified `project.json` for `ai-chat-core`: `executor` is `nx:run-commands`, `command` and `cwd` paths are correct.
        *   No changes to `package.json` were ultimately needed for this target's executor.
    *   **Current Status:** **SUCCESSFUL.** The command `npx nx run ai-chat-core:install-deps` now executes the script and completes successfully.

*   **`nx graph` Issue:**
    *   **Problem:** `npx nx graph` started, but its daemon later closed the connection.
    *   **Current Status:** Not re-tested. This may also be related to the Node.js version incompatibility.

*   **`npm install` Warnings:**
    *   **Problem:** `npm install` in `sylo-monorepo/` completed with warnings (peer dependencies, Node.js engine mismatch).
    *   **Current Status:** Warnings persist, particularly the `EBADENGINE` warning for Node.js version.

**Overall Recommendation:**
The most critical step to resolve ongoing Nx issues, particularly for `api-main`, is to align the Node.js development environment with the versions supported by `nx@21.0.3` (i.e., Node.js `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0`).

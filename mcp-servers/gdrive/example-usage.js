/**
 * Example usage of the Google Drive MCP server
 * 
 * This file demonstrates how to use the Google Drive MCP server
 * through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
 * 
 * Note: This is a demonstration file and not meant to be executed directly.
 * The AI assistant will use similar patterns to interact with Google Drive.
 */

// Example 1: Searching for files in Google Drive
// The AI assistant would use the search tool like this:
/*
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/gdrive</server_name>
<tool_name>search</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "query": "budget spreadsheet"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
*/

// Example response from the search tool:
const searchResponse = {
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz",
      "name": "2025 Budget Planning.xlsx",
      "mimeType": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"
    },
    {
      "id": "2BcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ",
      "name": "Q1 Budget Review.gdoc",
      "mimeType": "application/vnd.google-apps.document"
    }
  ]
};

// Example 2: Accessing a file's content
// The AI assistant would access a file like this:
/*
<access_mcp_resource>
<server_name>github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/gdrive</server_name>
<uri>gdrive:///1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz</uri>
</access_mcp_resource>
*/

// Example response when accessing a Google Sheet (converted to CSV):
const sheetContent = `
Date,Category,Amount,Notes
2025-01-15,Office Supplies,125.99,Printer paper and toner
2025-01-22,Software,299.00,Annual subscription
2025-02-03,Travel,450.75,Client meeting expenses
2025-02-17,Marketing,1200.00,Social media campaign
`;

// Example 3: Accessing a Google Doc (converted to Markdown):
/*
<access_mcp_resource>
<server_name>github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/gdrive</server_name>
<uri>gdrive:///2BcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ</uri>
</access_mcp_resource>
*/

// Example response when accessing a Google Doc:
const docContent = `
